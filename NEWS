Changes in 0.6
==============

* Many changes after code review by Miroslav Trmac:
 - Always require user-administration privilege when setting a password
   or changing a username
 - Allow changing password mode and password even when the account is
   locked, and unlock it as a side-effect
 - Use /etc/shadow to store account locking and 'set password at next
   login' information and monitor /etc/shadow for changes
 - Set loginuid when runing commands on behalf of a user to generate
   proper audit records
 - Drop SetIconData and make SetIconFile copy the file when appropriate.
   As a consequence, the service no longer links against image libraries.
 - Various other robustness and error-handling fixes
